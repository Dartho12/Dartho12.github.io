    <li><a href="https://dartho02.itch.io/legend-of-zelda-nes-unity-remaster">The Legend of Zelda (Unity Remake)</a></li>
    <p>I designed the bomb, keese, Aquamentus, the prototype for the grid based design,
        locked doors and keys, the cheat for debugging, the movable blocks, the old man room, and the water tiles.
        I also added most of the Audio.

    <li><a href="https://dartho02.itch.io/swap"> Swap (Solo Prototype)</a></li>
    <p>A rapid prototype of a basic platformer developed and designed by me. Sprites 
        are downloaded assets however. The main novel mechanic is the ability to swap places
        with rocks in the environment in an effort to reach the cake at the end of each level.
